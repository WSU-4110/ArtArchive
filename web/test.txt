This is a 3D adaptation of the 2D map from Among Us. Instead of attempting to recreate the tasks and gamemode of the source material, I experimented with some of the gameplay mechanics and goals.

Half of the players are imposters while others are crew members. It's still free-for-all, however the vents and tasks are relegated to respective parties. 
Crew members can take advantage of weapon bonuses and brief powerups, while the Imposters can use teleporters and the BFG.
